I am delighted to say thaat i have Created an interactive navigation menu that changes color or style when scrolled or when hovering over a menu item.
The navigation menu has a fixed position and is visible on all pages.
HTML to structure the menu, CSS to style it, and JavaScript to add interactivity has been used to do tasks such as changing the background color or font color of the menu when it is scrolled or when a menu item is hovered over.
